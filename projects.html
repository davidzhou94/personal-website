          <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Using unconventional methods I fixed a program for which I did not have the source code.</p>
          <p>When I started working with MCB in 2009, they already had the report generation side of the process automated, but the developer that created that program has long since left and did not leave behind the source code for the project.</p>
          <p>For a long time this wasn’t a major problem, whenever the program wouldn’t run properly, we just found workarounds such as manually editing the report generated. The first big problem came when we started upgrading our hardware and discovered that the application could not run on x64 systems. In simple terms, the program was compiled (built) with the target CPU set to “any CPU” despite making use of components like Microsoft Jet that did not have x64 versions.</p>
          <p>The fix should’ve been relatively simple, all that needed to be done was to recompile the project with the target CPI set to “x86”. Unfortunately I didn’t have source code. The conventional way of doing things would have been to recreate the project, but for many years my programming skill was not up to task.</p>
          <p>After nearly a year of remote-accessing an x86 server for the sole purpose of running this one program, I got fed up and found a way to decompile the program. Good news was the decompiler ran like a charm. Bad news was the decompiled code was in a language I was unfamiliar with (C#) and the code was riddled with errors because many of the components it used were antiquated.</p>
          <p>Luckily, C# was similar to Java and easy to learn. After an afternoon of googling and experimenting, the program emerged fixed –and with extra features like generating reports in PDF, and batch processing.</p>

          <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The time it took to submit one questionnaire dropped from an average of 2 minutes to 20 seconds.</p>
          <p>The OCQ Extractor “suite” has been my pride and joy since 2009. It was around this time that my mom started working with Lionel Laroche, the president of MultiCultural Business Solutions. MCB (as we call it) had a product all the Organization and Culture Questionnaire that took client responses and quantified cultural differences in work-related behaviours.</p>
          <p>The problem was that despite being 2009, the company was still largely entering the questionnaires into their database by hand. Wanting to be supportive of my mom, I helped out on a few occasions and immediately realized how urgently this process needed to be automated.</p>
          <p>I took the existing questionnaire and using existing functionality in word, added bookmarks to the form fields to make it software-readable. I then built a program to extract the information, display it on screen, and allow changes to be made before submitting it to the existing database to await processing by another program.</p>
          <p>Suffice to say it saved quite a bit of time. In addition to this program I also wrote a few utility programs that checked the database and returned questionnaire files as well as a quick program that converts .DOC files to .PDF files in batches.</p>
          <p>The utility programs and the extractor program were all written in Visual Basic but also make use of Microsoft Jet, Microsoft Access, and Microsoft Word.</p>
