          <h3>Biography</h3>
          <p>
            I was born in 1994.
            My parents and I lived in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen before we moved to Canada in 2000.
            In 2006 my mom and I became Canadian citizens and that day is one of my happiest memories.
            Before high school, I attended three elementary schools,
            the last of which was because I qualified for the gifted program in my school board.
            I continued in the gifted program at Markham District High School from which I graduated in 2012.
            While at MDHS, I was fortunate to have had teachers who were exceptional.
            My high school had an unparalleled extra-curricular program,
            which I only realized to be unique after comparing with peers in university.
            On many school days I would get home just in time for dinner because I was staying for Improv,
            <a href="http://www.reachforthetop.com/" target="_blank">Reach for the Top</a> (trivia),
            LEAD (leadership), Debate, theatre, Computer Science (club),
            or the countless events of clubs my friends were in.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I first started at McGill in 2012 my goal was to major in Economics and Math as a first step towards a
            technical analyst role in a major international organization like the IMF or the UNDP.
            After failing Calculus II in my first year, I went back to the drawing board.
            I eventually settled on Computer Science (focusing on Software Engineering) and Economics.
            It seemed natural to be "back" in Computer Science.
            I had taken two courses in high school and learned programming as a hobby.
            The good career prospects were a motivating factor but I mostly made my decision because
            Computer Science is something I have always liked.
            It was the problem-solving aspect that I found particularly enjoyable,
            and by problem solving I really mean Googling StackOverflow.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my final year at McGill, I was lucky to have found a job early in the school semester
            so I could focus on my courses.
            That year, like many computer science students at McGill, I chose to take a couple graduate level courses.
            I took one in distributed systems and another in compiler design, where my team
            <a href="http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/~hendren/520/2016/" target="_blank">won a prize for best compiler</a>.
            Those two courses were easily the best courses I took at McGill,
            I continue to find them applicable in my work many years after graduating.
            After graduating in June 2016, I did some travelling with friends and family before moving to
            Boston to start work at Amazon Robotics in August 2016 where I am working now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite being very different from Montreal and Toronto, Boston quickly grew on me.
            I started at <a href="https://youtu.be/HSA5Bq-1fU4" target="_blank">Amazon Robotics</a>
            with a team focused on making data for the robotic inventory system highly available.
            I worked on problems like reducing database throughput consumption with distributed caching and
            enabling authorization, authentication, and auditing security on web services.
            I also started helping out with other teams, one of the projects I took on was an algorithm enhancement
            that factored the center-of-gravity of shelving units so that addition of inventory would prioritize
            moving the center-of-gravity towards stability.
            In late 2017 I helped out on a project to simulate a new use case for the robots.
            Things moved really fast, by end of 2017 I was on a brand new team to build brand new software that
            eventually launched Amazon's first robotics enabled transportation facility in 2018.
            This <a href="https://youtu.be/4MH7LSLK8Dk" target="_blank">video</a>
            is taken at that first facility in Denver and this
            <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-warehouse-robots/" target="_blank">article in Wired</a>
            goes into more depth.
            I went to Denver twice to support the project in 2018, it was the first time I traveled for a work project
            and the furthest west I had been in the US at that time.
            Right after the Denver facility launch, along with my team, I started working on new transportation
            projects that have not yet been reported in the media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I volunteer on a couple projects important to me.
            I serve on the board of the
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/McGill.Boston/">McGill Alumni Association of Boston</a>.
            I've returned to McGill every Fall semester since 2017 to recruit on behalf of Amazon Robotics and
            I offer mentorship services to McGill students.
            When I first started at Amazon, I also volunteered with an outreach group that visited a middle school
            in Lynn, MA weekly to help sponsor and mentor the robotics club there.
            A co-worker and friend from that experience got me involved with teaching
            <a href="https://www.phacs.org/apps/pages/programs/STEAMSaturday">STEAM courses at Prospect Hill Academy</a>,
            where I taught students a course on computer circuits and introductory computer science concepts.
            In 2019, I switched to 1-1 mentorship with students in the AP Computer Science course
            where we worked on an National Honours Society project.
